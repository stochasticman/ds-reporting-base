\section{Introduction}

To calculate velocity, start like this:

\begin{equation*}
v = \frac{s}{t}
\end{equation*}

\section{Why tho?}


I like to just focus on content and not the actual alignment and formatting of my words. I don't have to lift my fingers away from the keyboard to do anything! 

Be careful though, you may have to enable word wrap on your text editor as \LaTeX lines can be really long!

I can make matrices! 

\[
    \left[
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            a&b&c\\d&e&f    
        \end{array}
    \right]
\]

I can split my document into several pieces and import them into the main one!

I can use version control! Everything is just text!

Did you notice that the table of contents has links \hyperlink{toc}{?} Try hovering over the question mark you just passed to see what's going on.
